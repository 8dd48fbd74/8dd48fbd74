## Idea

Opensource is an awesome thing. Together we could make it even better.

This project is an attemp to create an open market for contributors, not the one using *money*, but the one where people combine their skills to contribute mutually for their projects. Where people could barter their work for others' work, give design for markup, javascript code for testing stuff, time spend on maintaining a project given in exchange for someone's backend work and all other possible combinations.

Work for work, skills for skills, time for time.

Imagine a place, where you could list all your skills and things you'd like to do and then tell people of your ideas and projects. And people who would want your help would come and work for your project, and you would work for theirs.

That would be a place, where you could find your dream team to create different projects together.

That's the idea for this project, that's what we would try to create. Join us!

And edit this poorly written text btw!
